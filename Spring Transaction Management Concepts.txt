Transaction Management:
A -> Atomicity = All or None
C -> Consistency = Transaction should leave system in consitent state. Sum of amounts of both accounts should be same before and after transaction.
I -> Isolation = Result of the transaction should be same even if it runs in sequence or in parallel
D -> Durability = If all steps performed successfully then it should persist the state even if there is data crash occurrs.

Dirty Read:
In a transaction, if thrad A has modified a value and thread B reads a value though thread A has not completed.

Non-Repeatable Reads:
If in a transaction same query hit at different places and gives different results called as not-repeatable reads.

Phantom Reads:
In the same transaction if I hit the same query at different point gives different number of rows is called as Phantom Reads.

To prevent Dirty Read, Non-Repeatable Reads and Phantom Read we can use Isolation Level.

There are 4 isolation levels:
1. Read Uncommitted
2. Read Committed
3. Repeatable Reads
4. Serialization


								Dirty Read				Non-Repeatable reads		Phantom Read
Read Uncommitted				Not Solved				Not Solved					Not Solved
Read Committed					Solved					Not Solved					Not Solved
Repeatable Reads(Read Lock)		Solved					Solved						Not Solved	
Serialization					 Solved					Solved						Solved	
(Read + Write + Range Lock)
